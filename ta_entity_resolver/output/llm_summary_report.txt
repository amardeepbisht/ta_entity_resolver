**Recommendations:**
Given the absence of matched pairs and clusters, as well as the lack of flagged items, it is recommended to review the data input process to ensure that records are sufficiently varied and complete for future analyses. Additionally, consider running the entity resolution process again with a larger dataset to enhance the likelihood of identifying meaningful clusters and relationships among vendor entities.
